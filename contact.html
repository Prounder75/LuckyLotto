          <legend>A Common Question or Two:          </legend>
          <dl>
          <dt>Do you actually play any Lottery?</dt>
          <dd> Yes, I do. I always keep an eye on both the PowerBall and Mega Millions lotteries and when those  
          jackpot amounts start climbing, I start driving, to the local store, to buy my tickets. I actually keep my lottery scan card,  in my car so I don't have to fill out a new one 
          each time I buy tickets. </dd>
          <dt>Why don't you list the total times a single number has hit in all combinations? </dt>   
          <dd>This question means if for example the number 16 hit 10 times as single number, 5 times in  two combination sets, 4 times as three way combo why don't we list the frequency,
          in this case 19, that one number has hit in all combinations. 
          <div id= "lngAsw">That idea has been and is still being considered. For the moment we list the outcome as if the numbers were played lottery tickets. Displaying the result as if  
          a lottery ticket was scanned for each game played and counted based on those results. However if enough readers comment or send emails requesting this that feature it will 
          be added to the listed results.</div></dd>
          <dt>Since  both the Powerball and MegaMillions have made changes to their games (as recent as October 19, 2013) what is the earliest drawing dates  you get information from?</dt>
          <dd> Even with the changes, we still gather data from over ten years of drawings. The earliest data drawn for each lottery are:
            <ul id = "dates">
            <li> <h4 class="backDates">PowerBall</h4>
            : Drawings from November 1997</li>
            <li> <h4 class="backDates">MegaMillions</h4>
              : Drawings from December 2003</li>
            <li> <h4 class="backDates">Hot Lotto</h4>
              : Drawings from March 2002</li>
            </ul>
            </dd>
